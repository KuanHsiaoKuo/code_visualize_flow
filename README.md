## Design Philosophy of PGLogger

The `PGLogger` class is crafted to track and log Python programs' execution process, typically for educational or
analytical tools. By capturing the dynamic behavior of running code, such as variable changes, function call stacks, and
exception information, PGLogger acts as a simplified debugger. It is designed to provide an insightful, interactive
experience into understanding Python code execution.

### Key Features

1. **Code Tracing and Execution Logging**:
    - Utilizes the `bdb.Bdb` class framework to monitor the execution flow of Python code.
    - Logs events related to function calls, line executions, returns, and exceptions.

2. **Output Capturing**:
    - Redirects and captures standard output (`sys.stdout`) to create faux streams for different modules, allowing
      separate streams per module.

3. **Security Management**:
    - Implements a basic sandbox by restricting file descriptor access and blocking potentially dangerous built-ins and
      module imports.

4. **State Management**:
    - Maintains information about stack frames, global variables, and heap objects.
    - Outputs this data in a structured format for visualization and analysis.

5. **Custom Module Support**:
    - Executes code from custom modules and imports their content to help set the initial environment and context before
      running user scripts.

### Implementation Strategies

- **Initialization**: In the `__init__` method, PGLogger sets up its attributes, such as control flags for cumulative
  mode, safety assertions, modular output streams, etc.

- **Bdb Method Overrides**: Core methods like `user_call`, `user_line`, `user_return`, and `user_exception` are
  overridden to finely control the execution trace collection process.

- **Execution Management**: The `interaction` method centrally handles the processing of all execution events, updating
  stack information and managing exceptions and user-defined breakpoints.

- **Termination Control**: Methods `force_terminate` and `finalize` define termination logic to end script execution
  gracefully upon reaching step limits or encountering infinite loops.

### Design Motivation

- **User-Friendly Interaction**: Aimed at educational use, providing a clear view of program execution and behavior.
- **Security and Isolation**: Ensures safe tracing by implementing simple sandbox restrictions.
- **Flexibility and Extensibility**: Easily adaptable through custom modules and variables, enabling extended usage.

### ASCII Flow Design Diagram

Below is a simplified representation of the PGLogger's design flow:

```
+---------------------+
|    Initialize       |
|                     |
| - Set control flags |
| - Prepare stdout    |
|   streams           |
+---------+-----------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|      Execute        |
|                     |
| - Load user script  |
| - Override Bdb      |
|   methods           |
+---------+-----------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
| Interaction         |
| - Handle events     |
| - Update stack info |
| - Check exceptions  |
+---------+-----------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|  Termination        |
| - Force quit        |
| - Call finalizer    |
|   if needed         |
+---------------------+
